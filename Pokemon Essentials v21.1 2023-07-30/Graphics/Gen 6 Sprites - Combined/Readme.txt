All the sprites here come from two different repositories, both with valid shortcut and credits in the /credits folder of this download.

I really don't want to be credited for this, literally all I did was convert them to Essentials-format, lol. Credit the actual authors and artists. 

The sprites will need readjustment in-game so they look correct. You can do that in the debug options- I'd highly recommend doing it manually, as automatic readjustment will readjust the existing Pokemon entries- stuff which was already configured properly.
