All the sprites here come from the "DS-style Gen VII and Beyond Pok√©mon Sprite Repository in 64x64" frum on Pokecommunity. A shortcut link and credits can be found in the credits folder.

I really don't want to be credited for this, literally all I did was convert them to Essentials-format, lol. Credit the actual authors and artists. 

The sprites will need readjustment in-game so they look correct. You can do that in the debug options- i'd highly recommend doing it manually, as automatic readjustment will readjust the existing Pokemon entries- stuff which was already configured properly.

The icons are apparently not the best, so if you're not fond of them, you can pick up another pack which has similar, but better colored, icons, located here: https://reliccastle.com/resources/383/ (As a bonus, it also has Gen 6-8 Pokemon as a whole; be sure to credit Mashirosakura and the other people listed here if you use their work!)
