[SPOILER][B]Pokemon[/B]
[LIST]
[*]Updated move learn sets of all species.
[*]Made it so that Pokemon can now have moves added to their level-up learn set that are learned at level -1. This is used for Move Relearner-exclusive moves that the Pokemon isn't meant to learn at any level, not even level 1. This is a feature that was introduced in Scarlet & Voilet.
[*]Added Move Relearner-exclusive moves to the learn sets of all appropriate species.
[*]Added the appropriate form names to all Gen 9 and PLA species.
[*]Added Tera Blast to the tutor move list of all eligible species. This includes everything besides Magikarp, Ditto, Smeargle, Unown, Wobbuffet, and Wynaut.
[*]Added the "Paradox" flag to all paradox species.
[*]Added the "Mystical" flag to all mystical Pokémon.
[*]Added the "Legendary" flag to all legendary Pokémon.
[*]Added the Linking Cord as an alternative item-based evolution method for Kadabra, Machoke, Graveler and Haunter, like it's used in PLA.
[*]Added in battle effect for the Illumate ability.
[*]Gave Tandemaus a normal level-up evolution method, and removed the method it used previously.
[*]Gave Bisharp the Leader's Crest as its uncommon wild held item.
[*]Gave Iron Leaves/Walking Wake tentative Pokedex entries based on Pokemon Home.
[*]Change Overqwil evolution requirement to level up after using Barb Barrage at least 20 times.
[*]Change Sneasler evolution requirement to level up while holding a Razor Claw during the day.
[*]Rename the walk evolution method name to :LevelWalk.
[*]Updated Kleavor and Hisuian Zoroark stats.
[/LIST]

[B]Moves[/B]
[LIST][*]All PLA moves updated to have the appropriate stats that they have in Scarlet/Voilet.
[*]All of the newly added moves have been given the appropriate move flags that they're supposed to have.
[*]Renamed the function codes for nearly all of the newly added moves in this plugin.
[*]Added appropriate move flags for compatibility with the PLA Battle Styles plugin.
[*]Added new move function "RecoilHalfOfTotalHP" for Chloroblast.
[/LIST]

[B]Abilities[/B]
[LIST][*]Implemented Futuresushi's shortened Ability descriptions so that they don't break the default Essentials UI.[/LIST]

[B]Items[/B]
[LIST][*]Shortened the description of certain items so they no longer break the default Essentials UI.
[*]Added missing Fling damage flags on several items.
[*]Added appropriate item flags for compatibility with the Terastal Phenomenon plugin.[/LIST][/SPOILER]

[U][SIZE="5"]Scripts[/SIZE][/U]
[SPOILER][B]General[/B]
[LIST][*]Overhauled all of the code in the entire plugin. Implemented aliases wherever possible to avoid overwriting huge portions of code. This should make the plugin more efficient, while also much more inherently compatible with loads of other plugins, as well as custom script changes. Also rewrote and renamed entire methods for more clarity, and added new methods for more convenience.
[*]Restructured and reorganized how the plugin scripts are named and sorted to be more accessible and easy to use.
[*]Created a new Settings file to customize some of the new mechanics added by this plugin.[/LIST]

[B]Related to Pokemon[/B]
[LIST][*]Added the feature which allows for Move Relearner-exclusive moves in a species' learn set.
[*]Added the feature which allows Pokemon in the party to inherit Egg Moves from each other when a Mirror Herb is held. This is checked for as the player walks, and will pass a random compatible Egg Move to the Mirror Herb holder every 100 steps or so. The Pokemon must have an empty move slot to inherit any Egg Moves.
[*]Added a feature to the Pokemon Summary. You can now Nickname a Pokemon directly in this UI when you open the Options menu. In addition, you can also relearn or forget moves directly from their Moves page, as well as teach them any compatible TM's.
[*]Reworked the evolution handlers for all of the new evolution methods added by this plugin. They should now be tracked far more accurately, with less bloat.
[*]Fixed an issue where this plugin previously overwrote Alolan and Galarian species spawning in their correct forms when hatched from eggs. All regional forms should now hatch from eggs in the correct form.
[*]Made it so Quilava, Dewott, and Dartrix will now automatically be forced into form 1 if you are in the Hisui region (region 3 by default). This allows them to appropriately evolve into their Hisuian evolutions.
[*]Fixed a typo in Squawkabilly's form handler that prevented it from correctly spawning in random forms.
[*]Added in battle effect for the Illumate ability.[/LIST]

[B]Related to Battle[/B]
[SPOILER][B]Weather[/B]
[LIST][*]Overhauled the Hail weather so you can now toggle four different versions of this weather with [ICODE]HAIL_WEATHER_TYPE[/ICODE] in the plugin Settings.
[LIST][*]0: The normal Hail weather that exists in vanilla Essentials by default. Deals damage to non-Ice types each turn.
[*]1: The new Snow weather that replaces Hail. This is the Gen 9 version of this weather that boosts the Defense of Ice-type Pokemon by 50%.
[*]2: A Hailstorm weather that combines Hail and Snow. This is a custom weather that combines all three effects above into a single weather type.[/LIST][/LIST]

[B]Statuses[/B]
[LIST][*]Drowsy
[SPOILER]Added the Drowsy status introduced in PLA. This status can be used in two ways. If [ICODE]SLEEP_EFFECTS_CAUSE_DROWSY[/ICODE] is set to true in the plugin Settings, then all effects in the game that would normally inflict or check for the Sleep status will now call the Drowsy status instead. This effectively replaces Sleep in your game with the Drowsy status. If this is instead set to false, then Drowsy and Sleep are treated as unrelated status conditions, and may be inflicted independently of each other. Note however, that you'll have to customize moves and effects to specifically apply the Drowsy status in this case.

[U]Drowsy status effects:[/U]
[LIST][*]The user has a 33% chance to be unable to act each turn. This doubles to 66% in Snow/Hail.
[*]The user takes 33% more damage from attacks while Drowsy.
[*]Drowziness may end naturally after 3-4 turns.
[*]Drowsiness may end early if a move with the "ElectrocuteUser" flag is used on or by the user.[/LIST]

[U]Interactions:[/U]
[LIST][*]All items that may be used to cure the Sleep status will now also do so with the Drowsy status. This includes the Chesto Berry, Awakening, Blue Flute, and Poke Flute.
[*]All moves that cure the Sleep status will now also do so with the Drowsy status. This includes Aromatherapy/Heal Bell, Jungle Healing/Lunar Blessing, Psycho Shift, Wake-Up Slap, and Uproar.
[*]All abilities that prevent or cure the Sleep status will now also do so with the Drowsy status. This includes Insomnia/Vital Spirit, Healer, Hydration, and Shed Skin.
[*]The Synchronize ability may now also pass on the Drowsy status.
[*]Added the [ICODE]DrowseTarget[/ICODE] function code to be given to moves to allow them to inflict the Drowsy status.[/LIST][/SPOILER]

[*]Frostbite
[SPOILER]Added the Frostbite status introduced in PLA. This status can be used in two ways. If [ICODE]FREEZE_EFFECTS_CAUSE_FROSTBITE[/ICODE] is set to true in the plugin Settings, then all effects in the game that would normally inflict or check for the Frozen status will now call the Frostbite status instead. This effectively replaces Freeze in your game with the Frostbite status. If this is instead set to false, then Frostbite and Freeze are treated as unrelated status conditions, and may be inflicted independently of each other. Note however, that you'll have to customize moves and effects to specifically apply the Frostbite status in this case.

[U]Frostbite status effects:[/U]
[LIST][*]The user takes damage at the end of each round equal to 1/16th their max HP.
[*]Damage dealt by the user's special attacks is halved.
[*]Frostbite may end early if a move with the "ThawsUser" flag is used on or by the user.[/LIST]

[U]Interactions:[/U]
[LIST][*]Made it so that moves that have a chance to inflict Frostbite will have their chances doubled when used during Hail/Snow.
[*]All items that may be used to cure the Frozen status will now also do so with the Frostbite Status. This includes the Aspear Berry and Ice Heal.
[*]All moves that cure the Frozen status will now also do so with the Frostbite status. This includes Aromatherapy/Heal Bell, and Jungle Healing/Lunar Blessing.
[*]All abilities that prevent or cure the Frozen status will now also do so with the Frostbite status. This includes Magma Armor, Healer, Hydration, and Shed Skin.
[*]The move Psycho Shift and the ability Synchronize may now also pass on the Frostbite status.
[*]Added the [ICODE]FrostbiteTarget[/ICODE] function code to be given to moves to allow them to inflict the Frostbite status.[/LIST][/LIST][/SPOILER]

[B]Moves[/B]
[SPOILER][LIST][*]Added the [ICODE]DrowseTarget[/ICODE] function code to be used by custom moves to inflict the Drowsy status.
[*]Added the [ICODE]FrostbiteTarget[/ICODE] function code to be used by custom moves to inflict the Frostbite status.
[*]Added the [ICODE]StartSplintersTarget[/ICODE] function code to be used by custom moves to inflict the Splinters effect from PLA.
[*]Added the [ICODE]DamageTargetAddSpikesToFoeSide[/ICODE] function code to apply Spikes to the opposing side with a damage-dealing move, like the Gen 9 version of Ceaseless Edge.
[*]Added the [ICODE]DamageTargetAddStealthRocksToFoeSide[/ICODE] function code to apply Stealth Rocks to the opposing side with a damage-dealing move, like the Gen 9 version of Stone Axe.
[*]Added the [ICODE]ElectrocuteUser[/ICODE] flag to be given to moves. This functions how the [ICODE]ThawsUser[/ICODE] flag does, but for the Drowsy status.

[*][U]Tailwind[/U]: Added the missing proc for the Wind Rider ability.
[*][U]Charge[/U]: When MECHANICS_GENERATION is set to 9+, the Charge effect will remain on the user indefinitely until they either switch or use an Electric-type move, instead of counting down each turn. This applies to all other effects that apply the Charge effect, too.

[*][U]Stone Axe[/U]: This move now properly applies Stealth Rocks on the opponent's side. If MECHANICS_GENERATION is set below 9, this move will inflict the splinters effect instead, like it does in PLA.
[*][U]Collision Course[/U]: This move and other moves like it now have the proper damage modifier applied to Super Effective hits.

[*][U]Silk Trap[/U]: This move now works as intended, as previously the check for this move wasn't initialized properly.
[*][U]Glaive Rush[/U]: After using this move, the any attacks against the user will now have perfect accuracy, as intended. This vulnerable state now ends immediately after the user uses its next move, instead of always lasting until the end of the next turn.
[*][U]Spicy Extract[/U]: This move now raises/lowers the targets stats by the correct number of stages.
